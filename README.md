👋 Hi, I'm Mehdi Ben Khadra

Cybersecurity student at Epitech (Bachelor’s), AI builder, and technical founder focused on designing secure, high-impact systems.

I specialize in cybersecurity, automation, and AI-driven systems, with a strong interest in how offensive security, defense engineering, and artificial intelligence intersect.

At 18, I don’t just study technology — I build production-grade systems that combine security, scalability, and intelligence.

🚀 What I’m Currently Working On
LeadFlow — Autonomous AI Sales Agents

Co-founder & Lead Developer of LeadFlow, a platform that builds autonomous AI agents to replace traditional B2B prospecting teams.

LeadFlow agents:

Automatically research companies and decision-makers

Generate human-level personalized emails

Call prospects using low-latency natural AI voice

Qualify leads and book meetings 24/7

This project merges my core interests:

AI systems × automation × secure architectures × real-world deployment

🛡️ Cybersecurity Experience

I actively develop my technical security skills through hands-on competitions and community involvement:

Hack The Juice (CTF) — Practical experience in:

Web exploitation

OSINT

Cryptography

Privilege escalation & system vulnerabilities

OWASP Community — Focus on:

Web application security
